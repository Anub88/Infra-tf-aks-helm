# Python Training (Khaleel)

**Goal** 

1. Bring app. devs up to speed on python business app. development
2. Enable devs to teach themselves

- No *"two weeks course"*, must be combined with regular work
- Hands on approach to built confidence and carry non proactive folk, change handling of mistakes

## Basics

Syntax: Loops, Control, Assignments, Expressions etc.

- Not too deep
- Focus on differences compared to C-style langs.

Structure: Modules/Packages
    
Dependencies: Pip, Poetry, Conda

## OOP

Class: Dunder functions, methods/static, combination

- Would not focus on inheritance/advanced OOP       features -> Business logic not that big 

## Testing / Documentation

- Unit/Integration testing, test fixtures
- Testing libraries, pytest etc.
- Mocking, especially API requests/responses

- Exception Handling, Error cascades
- Docstrings, Google format

## Advanced

- List comprehensions
- Generators
- Iterators
- (Decorators)


## Libraries/Tools

- Development
    VSCode w. Azure Extensions
    Rest Client
    Linters, Formatters

- Models & Validation
    pydantic, marshmallow

- REST
    FastAPI

## Probably Avoid

- Pythonic approach
- PEP8/PEP20
- Zen of python

## Avoid

- Memory and cpu considerations
- Multiprocessing
- ML/DP tools (Numpy,Plot,Tensorflow)
- File/Stream handling details
- Ext. C/C++ interfaces
- Global interpreter lock
- (Metaclasses)
- Functional programming
