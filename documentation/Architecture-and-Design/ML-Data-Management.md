# Overview
The term data management can be interpreted from two angles of AI: from AI training perspective, but also from AI inference perspective. Both aspects have different requirements and therefore require a different way of implementation.

## Data Management for AI Training
This section covers data management for AI training.

### Authentication and Authorization

### Data Preparation
Any data preparation (before inference) is currently assumed to be resonsibility of applications outside of the MLware solution. However, if data preparation steps can be generalized to be reused for different AI products, a data preparation step can become part of the MLware solution, as part of the MLware Workflow Engine.

### Dataset Management

### Data Versioning

### Data Drift
For data drift aspects, Azure ML dataset monitor could be used to track changes using baseline and target datasets.
