## AI Lifecycle
AI solutions follow a specific lifecycle, which needs to be supported in the overall MLOps processes and underlying infrastructure/technology:

- Data preparation (extract, transform, load operations)
- Training machine learning models with on-demand scale-out and scale-up
- Deployment of machine learning models as public or private web services
- Monitoring deployed machine learning models (such as for performance or data-drift analysis)
- Retiring machine learning solutions, including data cleansing
